### Considerations and Observations

In this DataSet we will be looking over the following. 

When comparing the global with the average tempurature in Houston, TX we can see that the tempurature does vary using a window of 1 for the moving average both for the global and the city date, we can clearly see the spike for this plot. Using the line plot we can we see when we move from 1 year to 5, we notice that the moving average line starts to get smoother, as well as both the 7 and 10 year marks too.

We can see that the min and max for both the world and for Houston, Tx does vary. While the avg are different we can see from our line plots that we are moving in the same direction over time. We see that from the min and max for the global and Houston never passed over 4.05 for that threshold.
